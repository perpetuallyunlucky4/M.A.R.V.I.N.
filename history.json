Here is a simple Python program that checks if a number is even or odd:\n```\nnumber = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\nif number % 2 == 0:\n    print(f\"{number} is even\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{number} is odd\")\n```\nThis program uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the number is even or odd. If the result of the modulo operation is 0, the number is even. If the result is not 0, the number is odd.\n\nYou can run this program in a Python interpreter or in a Python script file. To run it in a Python interpreter, you can copy and paste the code into the interpreter and press Enter. To run it in a Python script file, you can save the code to a file with a `.py` extension, such as `even_or_odd.py`, and then run the file using the `python` command in the terminal or command prompt.\n\nFor example, if you save the code to a file named `even_or_odd.py`, you can run it in the terminal or command prompt by typing `python even_or_odd.py` and then entering a number when prompted. The program will then check if the number is even or odd and print the appropriate message."
